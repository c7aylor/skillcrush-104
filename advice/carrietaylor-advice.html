			<h4>Stay Consistent and Never Stop Learning</h4>
			<p>When learning to design and/or code or learning a new language it's important to be patient with yourself and consistent with the learning. I had a few speedbumps along the way and although I lost some momentum for a while and had to take a break, I didn't stop and as soon as I could, I picked up where I left off. Also, welcome any opportunity to practice. Never stop learning. Technology moves too fast and you'll fall behind.</p>

			<h4>Love It</h4>
			<p>It's best if you love what you do. I truly believe that. If you don't like something, change it. You are not a tree. If you can't change it, change your attitude about it. If you can't do that, then do something else, but there is no point in doing something for a living that makes you miserable. There is too much of your life to consider.</p>

			<h4>Walk Away If You Need To</h4>

			<p>There are times when you spend so much time and energy on a project that after a while you feel tired, cranky and you're going cross-eyed from looking at that screen for so long. Every tweak or change you make is something else you're not happy with. That's when you need to just get right up and walk away for at least an hour and come back to it later with fresh eyes.</p>
